                <p>
                    Home Depot uses the design principle of visual hierarchy very effectively on their website. 
                    They primarily use it to emphasize certain departments, such as their ongoing Halloween and bathroom sales.
                    The other elements on the page are still present, like the navigation and search bar, but do not distract from the sales they are hoping to highlight.

                    The Drudge Report is a news website that aggregates links to news stories from numerous sources. The links are the primary focus of the site, with advertising space being the only other purpose it serves.
                    The website uses a lot of white space to make the black and red links stand out to visitors. This makes everything easy to read, as well as feel uncluttered, despite being just a collection of links.
                    It also emphasizes certain elements, such as the headlines, by creating a void around them.

                <p>
                    Amazon is an e-commerce website that allows merchants to sell various products to almost anyone worldwide. 
                    Their mobile site utilizes repetition through advertising different categories of products and sales, such as various "Alexa" products.
                    As you can see in the screenshot above, they use the same layout and style to display two different categories
                    by changing only the font color to help customers distinguish between them.
